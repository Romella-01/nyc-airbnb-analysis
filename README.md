# NYC Airbnb Listing Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data from New York City to identify the key factors that influence listing prices. The goal was to practice the full data analysis lifecycle: data cleaning, exploration, SQL analysis, and visualization.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- **SQL** (Google BigQuery) for data aggregation and analysis.
- **Google Looker Studio** for creating an interactive dashboard.

## Key Insights
- **Location is the primary driver of price:** Listings in Manhattan are, on average, 33% more expensive than those in Brooklyn.
- **Room type significantly impacts cost:** Entire homes/apartments command a substantial premium over private and shared rooms in every borough.
- **Tribeca is the most expensive neighborhood:** With an average price of over $330 per night.
